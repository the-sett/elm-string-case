# elm-string-case

A library for converting between camel-case, snake-case, kebab-case and so on.

Some of the same functionality can be found in elm-community/string-extra, but a greater
degree of flexibility can be found here with options to control capitalization within
the string.

For example, you can have camel case where the first letter is capitalized or not, as in
"camelCase" or "CamelCase".
